# ABIN 2024: Assignment 1

This repository contains the solution to **ABIN Assignment 1** for the course **Algorithms in Bioinformatics (BIO321)**, conducted in **2024**.

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Motif-Finding Algorithms Implementation
Implement the following three motif-finding algorithms and discuss the trade-offs between computational complexity and the accuracy of motifs found by each:

- **a. Brute Force**
- **b. Median String**
- **c. Gibbs Sampling** (Iterations > 500)

### 2. Consensus Motif for 6-mer Length
For the DNA sequences provided (in a separate file), find the **consensus motif** of 6-mer length using all three algorithms and print their scores. Additionally, plot the time taken by each method.

### 3. Gibbs Sampling Analysis
**a.** Visualize how the **consensus motif score** changes with each iteration during the Gibbs sampling process.

**b.** Considering the inherent randomness in Gibbs Sampling, design and conduct an experiment where the algorithm runs multiple times. Analyze and plot:
   - The distribution of **consensus motif counts**.
   - The **average scores** obtained from multiple runs.

### 4. Algorithm Improvements & Optimizations
Reflect on potential improvements or optimizations that could be applied to each of the three algorithms. What strategies could enhance their performance or accuracy in practical applications?

## Submission Guidelines

- **Deadline**: Submissions must be made strictly before the deadline. No submissions will be accepted after the deadline without reasonable justification.
- **Format**: All code, outputs, and plots should be submitted in a single **Jupyter Notebook** file (`.ipynb`).
- **Important**: Ensure that the cell outputs are preserved in the submitted notebook file. If outputs are not present, grading will not be possible.
