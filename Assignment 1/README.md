ABIN 2024 : Assignment 1
ABIN assignment 1

Questions:
1. Implement these three motif-finding algorithms and discuss the trade-offs between
computational complexity and accuracy of the motifs found by each algorithm. :
a. Brute Force
b. Median String
c. Gibbs Sampling (Iterations > 500)
2. Find the consensus motif of 6-mer length for the DNA sequences provided (other file)
using all three algorithms and print their scores. Plot the time taken in all three
methods.
3. a) Visualize how the consensus motif score changes with each iteration during the
Gibbs sampling process.
b) Given the inherent randomness in Gibbs sampling, design and conduct an
experiment to run the algorithm multiple times. Analyze and plot the distribution of
consensus motif counts and average scores obtained in the experiment.
4. Reflect on the potential improvements or optimizations that could be applied to each
algorithm. What strategies could enhance their performance or accuracy in practical
applications?
Submission Guidelines:
Submit strictly before the deadline. No submission will be accepted after the deadline
without reasonable justification. Students must submit the code, outputs and plots all in a
single jupyter notebook file(.ipynb). The cell outputs must be preserved in the file that
is submitted for grading. It will not be possible to grade if the cell outputs are not
preserved in the jupyter notebook file.
Evaluation Criterias:

● Following submission instructions and questions answered.
● Clean code with comments and Markdown text in the jupyter file for explanation.
● Appropriately presented plots.
● Algorithmic implementation using modular/functional approach.
